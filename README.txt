This project I did with my schoolmate in 2019.
It was my first project in team. This is a 2D Tower defender prototype.
My part of this work was to make a GDD and small story. Also I did Enemy mechanics like hp,moving, spawning etc. 
Unfortunately the game didn't go forward, because of defferent interests inside of team.
I learned how communicate with associate and why it is important. Also it was first experience in 2D. More experience with UI and pixel graphics.
In code I practiced classes and enumators.
